## writing

The most rewarding part of technical writing, in my personal
perspective, is to understand the goal and the subjects really well.
Good writing will bring itself if one truly understands what is being
conveyed. There are, of course, other factors that help writing:
language skill is one that can be acquired over time and adjusted to
one's taste. Besides, being aware of the psychology, cognitive and
linguistic process behind the curtain help. Following are some *super*
entertaining works on this:

- [Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace](http://goo.gl/Xoi6m8 "Title")
develops a style that makes the best of "story telling", leveraging
ground breaking results in cognitive science, psycholinguistic etc.
It changes how I write on non-fictional subjects, in English as well
as Chinese (my native tongue).

- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555
"Title") tells the other half of story telling: the psychology on the
reader's side.

## beautiful tools

Computer science researchers are blessed with a great number of cute
and accessible (playing) tools. Some of the beauties are:

- long lived [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html "Title")!
- build website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Title")
