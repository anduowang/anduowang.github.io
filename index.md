My **research interests** center around improving networked-systems with database techniques and formal methods.

<u>I am looking for students and collaborators</u>. Do you want to change the networking practice by a simpler database-centered approach?

Check my [research]({{site.url}}/research.html), [cv]({{site.url}}/pdf/cv_anduo.pdf) for more details, and shoot me an email.
