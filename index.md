<!-- My research  centers around designing and building manageable (network) systems that leverage and re-ignite interests in database and formal methods. -->

My **research** improves networked-systems with rigorous methods. 

<!-- In particular, in the battle with system complexity, if knowledge representation and logic reasoning give a deep answer, does networking make a profitable problem? My research (supported by the National Science Foundation [Award CNS-1909450](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1909450&HistoricalAwards=false) and [CNS 1657285](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1657285&HistoricalAwards=false)) explores the pain points in today's network analysis and management --- such as unavailable information, uncertain environments, and non-monotonic dynamic behaviors --- to motivate initial conjectures to this question.  <\!-- _Why a database?_ SDN fundamentally revolves around data representation--representation of the network topology and forwarding, as well as the higher-level abstractions useful to applications. -\-> -->

My efforts have been an integral part of the broader initiative aimed at transitioning networks from guess-work protocols to disciplined software. What distinguishes my research is that it focuses on problems --- especially networking pain points under intense debate --- that do not easily fit into classic software engineering and formal methods that often presuppose a stand-alone and monolithic software architecture. If the emerging software infrastructure that constitutes modern networks --- such as the global Internet, hyper-scale datacenters, and Internet of Things in enterprises and homes --- is to truly thrive as before, it must surpass any software we already know. Motivated by the pervasive issues that these networks are never short of (to discerning eyes), my goal is to re-frame them using logic and adopting solutions developed for similar problems in automated reasoning, knowledge bases, programming languages, and more. In this sense, my overarching objective is to shape the future of networking by playing a unique role in collaborative efforts with passionate networking talents, while also revitalizing the elegant logic solutions accumulated over decades.

<!-- In particular, I consider semantic network management a new frontier in network advancement, and seek practical solutions by digging deeper into databases theories, while also borrowing heavily from knowledge representation and reasoning, programming languages, and formal methods. As computer networks become more programmable and complex, and as the networking community's effort in adapting solutions from other disciplines (eg., operating system, software engineering) steadily grows, it becomes a good time to revisit classical as well as unconventional database notions, so as to make a practical impact deserved by the database theories' true power, and to bring into network management a practical discipline that has been long sought-after. -->
