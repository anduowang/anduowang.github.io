I am a postdoc working with
[Matthew Caesar](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~caesar/ "Title") and
[Brighten Godfrey](http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/ "Title") in
[Department of Computer Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/ "Title") at
the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/
"Title").

My research centers around designing and building manageable network
systems that leverage and re-ignite interests in formal reasoning
(database theories, deductive formal methods, inductive machine
learning etc).

I'm joining
[Computer and Information Science](http://www.temple.edu/cis/ "Title")
at [Temple University](http://www.temple.edu/ "Title") as assistant
professor in January 2016. I am looking for collaborators and
students. *Have an appetite for solving system problems with
theory-powered tools? Want to try [research]({{site.url}}/research/)?*
