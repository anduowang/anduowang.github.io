<!-- My research  centers around designing and building manageable (network) systems that leverage and re-ignite interests in database and formal methods. -->

My **research interests** center around improving networked-systems with database techniques and formal methods. My current research projects focus on software-defined networks (SDN).

<u>I am looking for students and collaborators</u>. Interested in rigorous methods and real-world problems? Check my [research]({{site.url}}/research.html), [cv]({{site.url}}/pdf/cv_anduo.pdf) for more details, and drop me an email.
