My research centers around designing and building manageable (network) systems that leverage and re-ignite interests in database and formal methods.

<u>I am looking for students and collaborators</u>. Have an appetite for solving system problems with theory-powered tools? Want to try out your ideas on the  exciting and rewarding problems? Check my [research]({{site.url}}/research.html) and [cv]({{site.url}}/pdf/cv_anduo.pdf).
