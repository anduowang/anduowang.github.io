Assistant professor, [Computer and Information Science](http://www.temple.edu/cis/ "Title")
at [Temple University](http://www.temple.edu/ "Title"). I am looking for students and collaborators. *Have an appetite for solving system problems with theory-powered tools? Want to try [research]({{site.url}}/research.html)?*

<!-- I am a postdoc working with -->
<!-- [Matthew Caesar](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~caesar/ "Title") and -->

<!-- "Title"). -->

My research centers around designing and building manageable network
systems that leverage and re-ignite interests in formal reasoning
(database theories, deductive formal methods, inductive machine
learning etc).
